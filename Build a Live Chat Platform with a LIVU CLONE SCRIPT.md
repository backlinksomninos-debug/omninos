In the booming world of live video interactions, adopting a well-engineered LIVU CLONE SCRIPT gives you a strong foundation to launch your own 
interactive live-chat platform. With this script, you’re not starting from zero—you get a ready-made structure equipped for real-time video,
social discovery and monetisation, which you then tailor to your brand and audience.

What is a LIVU CLONE SCRIPT?

A LIVU CLONE SCRIPT is a white-label software solution that mirrors the key functionality of a social live video app similar to the original. It typically includes modules for live video matching, one-on-one chats, user profiles, filters/effects, virtual gifts, discovery features and a backend to manage users and payments. By using a clone script, you bypass the heavy lift of building core infrastructure and focus on branding, growth and monetisation.

Why choose the LIVU CLONE SCRIPT route?

Faster time-to-market: You can deploy your live video chat platform much quicker than building everything from scratch.

Lower development cost: Since many of the complex features are pre-built in the script, your investment and risk are significantly reduced.

Feature-rich foundation: The script brings the proven functionality users expect—live matching, chat, gifts, filters, discovery.

Brand flexibility: While the script provides the base, you still control branding, UI/UX, monetisation flow and feature customisation.

Scalable model: With the right script and architecture, you’re positioned to scale as user engagement grows and broadcasters join.
